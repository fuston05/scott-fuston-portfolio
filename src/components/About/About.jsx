                <p>
                    I am a Full Stack Web Developer and recent Lambda School
                    Graduate. I don't even have the words to express how excited
                    I am to begin searching for my dream job! I am so passionate
                    about every aspect of software development. It's very
                    gratifying to see a complex problem solved in an elegant
                    way. I love seeing a project come together after all the
                    hard work that goes into it! And probably most of all, I am
                    always looking forward to learning new things!
                </p>

                    For me It's not just about the code, cross-functional team
                    collaboration is an incredible experience that has a way of
                    bringing people together and building great friendships. A
                    good, diverse team leads to increased creativity,
                    productivity, and often to some very unique implementations.
